# Spotify Project


## This personal project consist in coding everything that it is need in order to:
    - Scrap top 200 artists and tracks from spotifychart during the summer 2019 in sweden
    - Extract feautres from spotify API with spotifyr of the previous Tracks
    - Analyze and graph the tracks that were most played and the ones that stayed longer in the top 200 during summer.
    
    
## it is possible to do more analysis which i will do in a near future about the relation of the features of the top tracks
   in order to see which are the most common factors about the succesful tracks in the swedish market in order to understand
   what users may like in songs.
